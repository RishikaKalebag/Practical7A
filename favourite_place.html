			Ajanta is one of the major tourist attractions of Maharashtra.The Ajanta caves near Aurangabad are
			well-known for their cave architecture, sculpture and murals.The caves have been declared as a World 
			Heritage Site by UNESCO.The 29 rock-cut caves at Ajanta were built between the 2nd century BCE and the
			8th century CE.The caves containing elaborate sculptures and paintings speak about the artistic brilliance
			of the ancient period.The fresco paintings on the walls of the Ajanta Caves depict scenes from the life 
			of the Buddha.The Jataka tales have also been 
			shown in the paintings.The 30 caves at Ajanta lie to the north of Aurangabad in the Indhyadri range 
			of Western Ghats. The caves, famous for their temple architecture and many delicately drawn murals, 
			are located in a 76 m high, horseshoe-shaped escarpment overlooking the Waghora (tiger) River.There are total
			30 individual caves in Ajantha.
			This is a vihara (monastery), therefore squarish in plan consisting of an open courtyard and verandah with 
			cells on each side, a central hall sided by 14 cells, a vestibule and garbha griha (inner sanctum). 
			Though located at a less than an ideal position of eastern extremity of the ravine its beautifully
			executed paintings, sculptural and architectural motifs make this cave truly fit for a king; for this
			is the “regal” cave patronised by Emperor Harisena.It contains the famed paintings of Bodhisvattas Padmapani and Vajrapani along with a seated figure of 
			Buddha in dharma chakra pravartana mudra in the sanctum. Other notable features include murals that depict
			Sibi, Samkhapala, Mahajanaka, Mahaummagga, Champeyya Jatakas and temptation of Mara.
